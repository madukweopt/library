You simply need to click the "add book" button and a form will appear where you can enter the details of the book and click "submit." Then your book will be added successfully. However, after submission, you can click on the edit button on the same row as the book you want to edit, and a form will show up again to enable you to do the editing. Also, if you want to remove a book from the library, simply click the "delete" button and the book will be successfully removed.
